# OpenMetroMaps

This is the main repository of the
[OpenMetroMaps](https://www.openmetromaps.org) project.

Data projects for cities/regions will be stored within the
[OpenMetroMapsData](https://github.com/OpenMetroMapsData) organization to keep
the namespaces for data and code projects separated.
