# OpenMetroMaps

This is the main repository of the
[OpenMetroMaps](https://www.openmetromaps.org) project.

Data projects for cities/regions will be stored within the
[OpenMetroMapsData](https://github.com/OpenMetroMapsData) organization to keep
the namespaces for data and code projects separated.

## Data projects

## Research

We're also gathering material about transit maps in general on the
[Research](https://github.com/OpenMetroMaps/OpenMetroMaps/blob/master/research/Research.md)
page.
